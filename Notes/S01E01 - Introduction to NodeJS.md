## 1. What is NodeJS?

- JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine
- Executes JavaScript code server-side
- Enables scalable network applications

---

## 2. Key Features

### a. JS Runtime

- Environment for executing JavaScript code
- Includes engine, APIs, and libraries
- Node.js allows running JS outside browsers (server-side)

### b. Cross-Platform

- Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux
- "Write once, run anywhere"

### c. Community & Management

- Managed by Node.js Foundation (now OpenJS Foundation)
- Collaborative effort: individuals, companies, organizations

---

## 3. Architecture

### a. Event-Driven

- Operates on an event loop
- Listens for events, executes callbacks
- Handles multiple operations concurrently

### b. Asynchronous I/O (Non-Blocking)

- Initiates I/O operations, continues other tasks
- Callback invoked when I/O completes
- Improves performance for I/O-heavy apps

## 4. Development History

| Year      | Event                                                                                 |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2009      | Ryan Dahl develops Node.js, switches from Spider Monkey to V8, supported by Joyent    |
| 2009–2010 | Node.js released as open-source, gains traction                                       |
| 2010      | Node Package Manager (npm) introduced                                                 |

| 2012      | Ryan Dahl steps away, Isaac Schlueter (npm creator) takes over                        |
| 2014      | Fedor forks Node.js to create io.js                                                   |
| 2015      | Node.js Foundation formed, io.js and Node.js merge (Node.js v4.0.0)                   |
| 2019      | JS Foundation and Node.js Foundation merge to form OpenJS Foundation                  |
